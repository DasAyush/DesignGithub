# GitHub Android App
It is an Android App for GitHub exhibiting its basic functionalities. 

## Purpose
There is no official Android app for GitHub at present. So, the users cannot get updates about the activities taking place
while they are on the move. 

Thus, our group decided to create an app for the same in order to provide the users with the basic functionalities of GitHub.

## Features
The basic features of the GitHub such as Feeds, Repositories, Organisations, Issues and Pull Requests have been implemented.
YouTube API has also been implemented as an additional feature.

1.  `Feeds` - It will show the activities that are taking in any of your repositories or organisations.

2.  `Issues` - The user will be able to `view` the issues and `comment` on them .

3.  `Repositories` - The user will be able to view his `public` or `private` repositories.

4.  `Organisations` - The user will be to view his own organisations and also, the ones he is a member of.

5.  `Pull Requests` - The user will be view and `merge` the pull requests.

6.  `Tutorial Videos` - This is an additional feature added by us. If a person is not well-versed in the topic or programming
language and he has difficulties in understanding any project, he/she can click on the provided link. This would redirect the
user to the `YouTube` tutorial videos relating to the subject.
